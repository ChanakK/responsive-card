# Card with transitions

This repository  hosts a card that was created using the following;

- HTML5
- CSS
- BEM

## Case study

Learned how to create a card and understood why BEM is important and understood about object oriented CSS and they are as follow;

- Container and content must be separate
- Skin and structure must be different

### Struggles

- Getting the lower half of the card to be a different color
- The image scaling to 1.15 when we hover over the card
  

### Solutions

- To get the lower half colored with a separate color, had to use padding inside the card elements

- Had to target the image like this `.card:hover img` 

### Findings

- On mobile devices `hover` does not work due to that created media-query and assigned it only to desktop sites.
